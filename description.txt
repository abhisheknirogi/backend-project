Project Description (Node.js Backend)
🛒 E-Commerce Backend API (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)

This project is a RESTful e-commerce backend API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following a clean separation of concerns with routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

The backend supports user authentication, role-based authorization, product management, cart handling, order processing, and payment workflows, making it suitable for real-world e-commerce applications.

Authentication is handled using JWT, with secure middleware to protect routes and restrict admin-only operations. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and easily extendable.

This project serves as a production-style backend and a reference implementation that is later recreated using FastAPI (Python) to demonstrate backend framework and language flexibility.

🧠 Key Features
🔐 Authentication & Authorization

User signup and login

Password hashing

JWT-based authentication

Token verification middleware

Role-based access (admin vs user)

Protected routes

🛍️ Product Management

Create, update, delete products (admin only)

Fetch product listings

Product data stored in MongoDB

🛒 Cart System

User-specific cart

Add/remove items

Quantity handling

📦 Orders

Order creation from cart

Order history per user

Order status tracking

💳 Payments

Payment data handling

Payment records linked to orders

📁 File Uploads

Image/file upload middleware (Multer)

Used for product images or assets

🧾 PROJECT UPDATE & MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST

(Keep this forever — this is what you asked for)

✅ CURRENT STATE (Already Done)

Mark these as ✅ mentally — you already have them.

 MVC-style backend structure

 Express server setup

 MongoDB models (User, Product, Cart, Order, Payment)

 JWT authentication

 Role-based access control

 Middleware for auth & admin

 File upload handling

 Modular routing

🔧 THINGS TO UPDATE / ADD (When You Revisit)
1️⃣ Documentation (HIGH PRIORITY)

 Create README.md

 Add project overview

 List all features

 Explain auth flow (JWT)

 List API endpoints

 Add setup instructions

 Add environment variables section

2️⃣ Configuration & Security

 Add .env.example

 Ensure no secrets are hardcoded

 Centralize error handling

 Validate request inputs

 Use proper HTTP status codes everywhere

3️⃣ Code Quality Improvements

 Remove duplicate middleware (auth.js, verifyToken.js if overlapping)

 Consistent naming conventions

 Controller logic cleanup

 Move reusable logic to utils/services

4️⃣ Testing (Optional but Strong)

 Unit tests for auth

 Basic API tests for products & cart

 Test protected routes

5️⃣ Deployment (Optional)

 Prepare for deployment (Render / Railway / EC2)

 Add production config

 Test deployed endpoints

🔁 FUTURE PLAN (IMPORTANT — don’t forget this)

This Node.js backend is frozen after cleanup.

Next step:

Rebuild the same system using FastAPI (Python)

Match:

Auth logic

Models

API behavior

Role-based access

Use this Node project as a reference architecture

This shows:

Backend fundamentals

Framework independence

Real-world experience

🎤 Interview Explanation (Save This)

“I built a production-style e-commerce backend using Node.js and MongoDB with JWT authentication, role-based access, and core features like cart, orders, and payments. Later, I recreated the same architecture using FastAPI in Python to demonstrate backend fundamentals independent of language or framework.”
